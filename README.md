# Tech Tutors

Tech tutors is an app designed to help connect students and tutors with a focus on web development skills.

On the home page there is some general information on the app with two links to either become a tutor or search for a tutor.

Both are given the same survey and the results are sent to a sorting algorithm.

After finding the best match, the user recieves some information about the tutor or student they are connected with.
